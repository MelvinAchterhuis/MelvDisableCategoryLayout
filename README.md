## A plugin for [Shopware 6](https://github.com/shopware/platform)

Disabled the layout content override for categories (unless specifically enabled).

Why would we need this?

* Create Shopping Experience and assign the layout to a category
* Someone makes a change via Category -> Layout
* Change is visible
* Someone else makes a change via the Shopping Experience
* Change is not visible, because layout is overridden via Category -> Layout
